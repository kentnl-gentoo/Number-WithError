Number::WithError
=================

DESCRIPTION

This class is a container class for numbers with a number of associated
symmetric and asymmetric errors. It overloads practically all common
arithmetic operations and trigonometric functions to propagate the
errors. It can do proper scientific rounding (as explained in more
detail below in the documentation of the "significant_digit()" method).

You can use Math::BigFloat objects as the internal representation of
numbers in order to support arbitrary precision calculations.

Errors are propagated using Gaussian error propagation.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In order to test the module thoroughly before installation, you need
Test::LectroTest. By setting the environment variable 'PERL_TEST_ATTEMPTS'
to a numeric value, you can force that number of attempts to falsify the
LectroTest properties. The default is a low and quick 100. For more
complete testing, something in the range between 1000 and 3000 is suggested.

If you version of Test::LectroTest is new enough to support recorded tests,
the feature is automatically used. (Requires version 0.35)

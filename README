Number::WithError version 0.03
==============================

DESCRIPTION

This class is a container class for numbers with a number of associated
symmetric and asymmetric errors. It overloads practically all common
arithmetic operations and trigonometric functions to propagate the
errors. It can do proper scientific rounding (as explained in more
detail below in the documentation of the "significant_digit()" method).

You can use Math::BigFloat objects as the internal representation of
numbers in order to support arbitrary precision calculations.

Errors are propagated using Gaussian error propagation.
